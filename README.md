Cryptocurrency Analysis Data Pipeline
This repository contains an end-to-end data pipeline for analyzing cryptocurrency data in real-time. The pipeline is built using Docker, Apache Kafka, Apache Airflow, and PostgreSQL, enabling efficient data ingestion, processing, storage, and analysis.

Overview
The Cryptocurrency Analysis Data Pipeline is designed to collect real-time data from cryptocurrency exchanges, process it, and store it in a PostgreSQL database for further analysis. The pipeline leverages Apache Kafka for real-time data ingestion, Apache Airflow for task orchestration and scheduling, and Docker for containerization and deployment.

Features
Docker containers used for all the services.
Real-time data ingestion from cryptocurrency exchanges using Apache Kafka.
Automated task scheduling and orchestration with Apache Airflow.
Data preprocessing and transformation to ensure data integrity and consistency.
Storage of processed data in a PostgreSQL database for analysis and visualization.
Integration with visualization tools for dynamic visualization of cryptocurrency price differentials and market trends.
